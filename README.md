Speaking on behalf of all teachers, there is an overwhelming amount of technological resources available to enhance learning and teaching and not a clear and efficient way to discover them or specifically categorize them. Our product asks teachers a series of questions focused on their background with technology and what they are trying to achieve in the classroom, then uses the data to find a set of education-related technological apps or platforms the teacher can use to improve the classroom learning dynamics.

Through trial and error of ideas (and many hours later) we agreed to complete this project. There was technological issues initializing the back end, but other than that there were no technological issues. Our group learned how difficult it can be to work as a team and solve a problem that a solution doesnâ€™t already exist for. Areas for future improvement would be to further populate our database with relevant information.
